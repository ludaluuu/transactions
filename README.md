# Outgoing transaction classifications
An application for displaying outgoing transactions with their classifications.
The application consists of a backend and a frontend.

## Running the backend
The backend is started by running by running *./gradlew bootRun* on **Mac** or **Linux**
or by running *.\gradlew.bat bootRun* on **Windows**. 

## Running the frontend
Before starting the frontend, make sure the backend is running.
Once the backend is running the frontend is started by moving into the frontend library 
and running *npm start*. Once it is started the application could be reached 
from a browser on http://localhost:3000
